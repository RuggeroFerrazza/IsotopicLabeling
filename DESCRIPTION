Description: The IsotopicLabeling package allows to analyse LC-MS data coming from isotopic labeling experiments. By looking at the isotopic patterns of the specified compound, the package estimates the isotopic abundance of the stable isotope employed during the labeling experiment (either ^2^H or ^13^C) within that compound.
