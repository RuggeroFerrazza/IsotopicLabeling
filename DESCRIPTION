Author: Ruggero Ferrazza, Pietro Franceschi
Maintainer: Ruggero Ferrazza <r.ferrazza@unitn.it>
Description: The IsotopicLabeling package allows to analyse the isotopic patterns in MS data obtained following isotopic labeling experiments; by looking at the isotopic patterns, the package estimates the isotopic abundance of the stable isotope employed in the labeling experiment (either 2H or 13C) within the specified compound.
