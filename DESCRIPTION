Author: Ruggero Ferrazza, Pietro Franceschi
Maintainer: Ruggero Ferrazza <r.ferrazza@unitn.it>
Description: The IsotopicLabelling package allows to analyse the isotopic patterns in MS data obtained following isotopic labelling experiments; by looking at the isotopic patterns, the package estimates the isotopic abundance of the stable isotope employed in the labelling experiment (either 2H or 13C) within the specified compound.
